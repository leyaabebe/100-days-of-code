# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**:<br> I've committed to the #100daysofcode challenge. I've completed 38 of freecodecamp's first coding challenges for the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts**<br> I'm not a complete newbie to coding, but I could get better at it. Today I restarted my freecodecamp account since I haven't been on it in ages.

### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:<br> Over 100 challenges into freecodecamp now. Briefly started a project on CodePen for a personal blog called ANIFAN.

**Thoughts**<br> In reviewing jQuery through the challenges, I was reminded that I would like to add interactivity or at least animation to the blog at some point. Looked at a few animation related css and js libraries.

### Day 3: January 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:<br> More FCC, drafted wireframe for project page of portfolio, and made edits to responsiveness of blog page.

**Thoughts**<br> Having done the tribute and portfolio projects before for FCC, I'm going to try to challenge myself more in its design. I think I'm going to aim to get the Front End Development Certificate done before the end of the month. I feel like I could do it. I didn't touch C# today, but hopefully I'll pick back up on it this weekend.

### Day 4: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:<br> Read articles on coding, but didn't do much coding today.

**Thoughts**<br> Feeling super sick. Had to take the day to recover. I was asleep for most of the day.

### Day 5: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**:<br> Started coding the personal website on CodePen as a project. Moved ANIFAN from project to pen on CodePen. Updated the links. I finally decided who to make a tribute page to—Hayao Miyazaki. I was reminded of him since today's his birthday.

**Thoughts**<br> My portfolio site is coming along! Yay! It's still mainly in template form, but coding it took time, and I'm happy that it works as well as it does. Using codepen, I can't include php files, but once I get every page's main layout down, I'll pull the code and keep working on it from Sublime text.

### Day 6: January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:<br> Finished Tribute page project and Portfolio project and more coding challenges for FCC.

**Thoughts**<br> The portfolio site needs more work, but it's definitely improved since yesterday. Having issues keeping the &equiv; in line with my name when at a mobile size. The height of the header also doesn't quite match what I'm setting it to for different @media queries. The actual screenshots for the website in the GIF needs to be redone as well as the GIF. I might also want to rethink the layout for the about section/page. (It's a section in order to meet the requirements of the challenge on FCC) As for the tribute page, I can see myself turning it into an animation via AE and loading it in. It would be cool to learn how to incorporate more interactions with code in the meantime.
