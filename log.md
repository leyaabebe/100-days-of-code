# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**:<br> I've committed to the #100daysofcode challenge. I've completed 38 of freecodecamp's first coding challenges for the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts**<br> I'm not a complete newbie to coding, but I could get better at it. Today I restarted my freecodecamp account since I haven't been on it in ages.

### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:<br> Over 100 challenges into freecodecamp now. Briefly started a project on CodePen for a personal blog called ANIFAN.

**Thoughts**<br> In reviewing jQuery through the challenges, I was reminded that I would like to add interactivity or at least animation to the blog at some point. Looked at a few animation related css and js libraries.
