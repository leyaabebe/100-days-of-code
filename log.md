# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've committed to the #100daysofcode challenge. *currently coding*

**Thoughts** I'm not a complete newbie to coding, but I could get better at it. I want to strengthen my knowledge and ability in coding in C#. I want to become more proficient so that I can code for Unity more easily.
