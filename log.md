# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**:<br> I've committed to the #100daysofcode challenge. I've completed 38 of freecodecamp's first coding challenges for the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts**<br> I'm not a complete newbie to coding, but I could get better at it. Today I restarted my freecodecamp account since I haven't been on it in ages.
